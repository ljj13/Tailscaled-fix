# v1.102.5-dnsfix.1

Fixes standalone Linux tailscaled DNS bootstrapping on rooted Android without
requiring `/etc/resolv.conf` or a loopback DNS listener. Discovers current Android
network DNS, validates it using the daemon's bypass mark, and uses configurable
public fallback when necessary. Refreshes on the routing watchdog; preserves
state and user configuration on upgrade. Adds DNS diagnostics and WebUI status.

See [DNS_FIX.md](DNS_FIX.md) and [TEST_RESULTS.md](TEST_RESULTS.md) for the design,
audit, local verification, and minimum device checks. Install the ZIP directly
over the existing module; do not uninstall first.

The original v1.102.5 release notes are retained below.

---

Self-contained KernelSU / Magisk / APatch module running `tailscaled` on a rooted Android device, with the routing it needs so browsers and apps can reach the tailnet and a peer's advertised subnets.

## Fixed: the daemon would not start

The previous builds used `GOOS=android`, which **cannot work** for a standalone daemon. `wgengine/router` takes its implementation from `router.HookNewUserspaceRouter`, and only `osrouter`'s platform files register it — while `osrouter/router_linux.go` is `//go:build !android`. Result:

```
wgengine.NewUserspaceEngine(tun "tailscale0") error: creating router: unsupported OS "android"
```

tailscaled exited immediately, so there was nothing to log into. (The official app only survives this by shipping its own Java `VpnService` router.) This build is **`GOOS=linux`**, and carries the three fixes a linux build needs on Android:

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Android's `main` table has no default route, but osrouter routes the daemon's own sockets with `ip rule … lookup main` → `network is unreachable` | the module keeps a default route in `main` and re-asserts it whenever netd rewrites the tables |
| Stock marks `0x40000`/`0x80000` collide with the permission bits of `netd`'s fwmark layout | `linuxfw-mark.patch` moves them to reserved bits (`0x10020000`) |
| A TPROXY proxy (Surfing/Clash) jumps `DIVERT` at mangle `PREROUTING` rule 1 and hijacks the tunnel's TCP replies — ping works, the browser hangs | `RETURN` for tunnel traffic is kept at rule 1 of `PREROUTING`, `OUTPUT` and nat `OUTPUT` |

## Subnets now need no configuration

osrouter puts the tailnet prefixes and **any subnet route you accept** into table 52 itself, at a rule preference ahead of netd's. So reaching `192.168.100.1` is just:

```
su -c 'tailscale set --accept-routes'
```

## Fixed: an install over another module's running daemon never took effect

`customize.sh` replaces the binary with `cp -f`, which overwrites **in place**. A
`tailscaled` that another module had already started therefore keeps executing the
old code, while the file on disk — and its hash — is already this module's. The
service then saw "a daemon is already running" and skipped starting its own, so
the module appeared installed and healthy while the previous build was still
running the show. That is why `mode:` read *standalone (no osrouter)* even though
this is a linux build with osrouter linked in.

- `customize.sh` now kills anything still using the state directory, whatever
  launched it.
- `daemon_is_current()` compares the process start time (`/proc/<pid>`) against
  the binary's mtime, and `start` restarts the daemon when it predates the binary.
- "Which build is this" is now answered by inspecting the **binary**
  (`has_osrouter`: does it link `ts-postrouting`?), not by guessing from the
  routing tables.
- The WebUI and `selftest` report it: *STALE, restart*.

## Fixed: broken helpers when installing over another module

`settings.ini` is deliberately kept on upgrade, so it can be one written by a
different module with no `diag()`/`log()`/`setup_home()`. Every `diag` call then
printed `diag: inaccessible or not found`. The service now defines whatever the
settings file does not.

## Changed: our own routes are installed unconditionally, at preference 5300

They used to be installed only for a "standalone" build, and at preference 12000
— which netd's `11000: from all iif lo lookup 1002` beats, making them useless.
Both osrouter's `5270` and ours (`5300`) now win over netd, and ours exists as a
fallback for the case where osrouter's routing is missing.

## New: `tailscaled.service selftest`

One command that answers "is the right binary running, and where does it break" —
binary hash vs. the guard, the binary's own version and arch, the routing mode,
the main-table default, table 52, the proxy exemptions, the reported OS, and a
`tailscale ping` plus a kernel `ping` against a real peer. Paste its output.

```
su -c 'tailscaled.service selftest'
```

If `reported OS` says `android`, some other module's binary is running, not this
one — this build reports `linux`.

## Fixed in this build

`show_diag`, `log_view`, `show_prefs`, `set_pref`, `routes_sync`, `logout_now`,
`show_exemptions`, `_jbool`, `_jstr` and `_onoff` had been dropped from the
service script by a bad edit, which left `tailscaled.service diag|log|prefs|
set-pref|routes-sync|logout` and the WebUI's Settings and Log tabs calling
functions that did not exist. All restored, and every command the dispatcher
references is now checked to exist.

## Simpler, faster WebUI

Three tabs instead of five, and no route editing to do:

- **Status** — state, tailnet address, backend state, account, and three health checks (binary guard, default route, proxy exemption), Start/Stop/Restart and Login.
- **Settings** — Accept subnet routes, Accept DNS, Shields up, Advertise as an exit node, device name, and Log out.
- **Log** — one pane toggling between the daemon log and the diagnostic dump.

Polls every 15 s instead of 5 s, and the status command no longer makes a second
`tailscale status` call per refresh.

## Still true

- arm64 only; binary guard plus a CLI that refuses `tailscale update`.
- Tailscale SSH is not included (`ts_omit_ssh`).
- Advertising this device as an exit node works; *using* one does not.
- No UPX.
